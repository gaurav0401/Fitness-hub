            <p style="background: rgb(128, 128, 128) ;">The EGYM Fitness Hub serves as go-to touchpoint for members right on the training floor for onboarding, measurements, and motivation. It acts as a knowledgeable guide on a member’s fitness journey with access to all relevant performance data. Operators and staff benefit from automatizing tedious manual tasks, like setting up individual machines and gaining time to focus on value-adding personal interaction. How does it work? In the article ‘Meet the EGYM Fitness Hub’ and ‘What Problems Is Fitness Hub Solving?’, we expand on how Fitness Hub addresses some of the most pressing customer and member needs, including a more accessible onboarding experience, facilitated regular assessments, and ongoing member motivation. 

                In a nutshell: With Fitness Hub, new member onboarding turns into an accessible and fully contactless experience, enabled by automatic measurement of the member and completed in just seconds using the latest 3D camera technology. Thanks to on-screen guidance, all recurring tests and assessments are completed in no time and now include flexibility and body composition measurements⁠.  With Fitness Hub’s built-in cheating detection, assessments are even available for self-service to members. Fitness Hub provides members access to their progress data at any time and in an easy-to-understand manner thanks to our intuitive metric: The EGYM BioAge.

                In just 2 minutes, EGYM machines are set up automatically, thanks to the latest in machine vision and machine learning. Using the Fitness Hub analysis, all settings for our Smart Strength machines are created automatically to exactly fit the person scanned. During the scan, the staff can keep a safe social distance to comply with increased safety and hygiene demands. Also, the increased speed of this process enables more options for improved processes: Either a seamless group onboarding session or using the time gained for additional personal interaction and services, such as personalized health and fitness consulting.
